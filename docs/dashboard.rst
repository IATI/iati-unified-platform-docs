=========

The :ref:`Dashboard` provides a range of summaries, statistics and computed metrics of IATI data. In addition to summarising current IATI data, it provides historical data for most of the metrics of which it keeps track.

The Dashboard provides an API which is the primary location for IATI data users to access IATI data, including accessing and searching the lists of reporting orgs and datasets.

   The <a href="../api-docs/dashboard-api/" target="_blank">Dashboard API Specification</a> (opens in a new tab) explains how to access IATI data via the API.


In addition to the API above, which allows for advanced querying, the Dashboard also provides a limited functionality `backwards-compatible CKAN API <../api-docs/dashboard-ckan-backwards-compatible-api/>`_ that mirrors some of the functionality of the CKAN-based Registry.
