Bulk Data Service
=================

The `Bulk Data Service <https://bulk-data.iatistandard.org>`_ runs on a continuous basis to maintain a copy of every file listed in the IATI Registry. The Bulk Data Service makes available a cached copy of each IATI file to allow access during temporary server outages, and in addition provides a ZIP file that allows all IATI files to be downloaded. 

The `Bulk Data Service API specification <../api-docs/bulk-data-service-api/>`_ explains what information about the download status of each IATI file is available.
