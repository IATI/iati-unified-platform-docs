Register Your Data API
======================

.. attention::

    The Register Your Data API was released in December 2025. If you believe that you will need to use it, please `contact us <https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/get-support/>`_ to discuss your work.

The Register Your Data API allows reporting organisations and third party tool developers to register IATI files, which will include them in the data pipeline and make the data available across the range of IATI tools.
