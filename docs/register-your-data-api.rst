Register Your Data API
======================

The Register Your Data API allows reporting organisations and third party tool developers to register IATI files, which will include them in the data pipeline and make the data available across the range of IATI tools.

The `Register Your Data API specification </api-docs/register-your-data-api.html>`_ explains how to register IATI files using the API.
