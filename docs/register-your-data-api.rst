.. caution::

    The Register Your Data API is currently under development. If you believe that you will need to use it, please contact us to discuss your work.

The Register Your Data API allows reporting organisations and third party tool developers to register IATI files, which will include them in the data pipeline and make the data available across the range of IATI tools.
